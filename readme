Script usage

The script accepts up to three command line arguments. If three are provided, they must are interpreted as the following:

1- the name of the compiler to use
2- the name (without extension) of the C source code file from which the executable is being produced
3- the name to use for the generated makefile

Arguments must be in that order.

For example, I can invoke my script this way:
./makingMaking gcc main Makefile

The result would be a new file called Makefile created, which makes the main excecutable with gcc.

If only two arguments are provided, they are interpreted as (1) and (2), and the user is prompted to enter a value for (3).
If only one argument is provided, it is interpreted as (1), and the user is prompted to enter values for (2) and (3).
If no arguments are provided, the user is prompted to enter values for (1), (2), and (3).
